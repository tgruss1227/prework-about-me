      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently owner of a Real Estate Investment and Venture Capital company which began operation
        in 2001.  Prior to 2001 I partnered with an ISP out of the InfoMart in Dallas. The ISP started out
        selling 64k and 128K lines to small and medium sized businesses in the metroplex area but eventually
        were selling T1 and T3 lines.  It was a full service ISP with email, web, domain servers along with 
        web devlopment and other services.   
      
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>While I grew in a midwest town in Nebraska, I moved to Texas as soon as I graduated from Highschool. 
        I have lived in many cities in Texas but have been in the Metroplex for over 30 years.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>If I have the time, I enjoy many outdoor activities including cycling, swimming and anything that allows
        me to soak up the sun.  That being said, I am definately a foody!  I love to frequent the many wonderful
        restaurants in Dallas.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have been self employed for many years but I am excited to explore new technology and all that it 
        offers.  I believe that after learning new skills, a dream job will present itself.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have lived all over the Metroplex but I have been in Dallas for around 20 years.  I currently
        live in a highrise in Victory Park.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development has changed alot over the last 20 years. So much more technology available to 
        help design and create robust environments.  I have aspirations of adding other tech skills to the 
        web development so that I can either help an existing company grow or create something of my own.
